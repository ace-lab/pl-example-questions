This repo contains a whole bunch of example question generators
(extracted from the main PrairieLearn repo).

Essentially, each subdirectory of this repo could be something that
would appear inside the `questions` directory of a course.

(An example course repo is
[here](https://github.com/ace-lab/pl-ucb-csxxx).)
